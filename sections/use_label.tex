\section{Use 1 \& 2: Training \& Evaluation}
\label{sec:app_label}

Manually created counterfactuals are used for evaluating models' decision boundaries~\cite{gardner2020contrast} and for counterfactual data augmentation~\cite{kaushik2019learning}, but \emph{creating} variations has been shown to be much more difficult than \emph{validating} them~\cite{ribeiro2018sear}.
With experiments on three datasets (more in \S\ref{appendix:app_label_data}), we show that just labeling the \sysname counterfactuals can serve similar purposes at a lower cost:
(1) \sst with Stanford Sentiment Treebank (\dsst)~\cite{socher2013recursive},
(2) \nli with \dnli~\cite{bowman-etal-2015-large}, and 
(3) \dqqp~\cite{wang2018glue}.

\subsection{Generating \& Selecting $\xp$ for Labeling}
\label{subsec:gen_counterfactual_for_labeling}

Not all counterfactuals have the same labeling utility, and we use the following two strategies to better compensate for the training space.

\emph{Targeted counterfactuals.}
\citet{longpre2020effective} found that typical data augmentations are likely to bring redundant benefits as pre-training, and suggested that the method should focus on where current models fail.
As such, in our training (\S\ref{subsec:augmentation}), we prioritize counterfactuals that can fulfill the model's known blind spots, by slicing the original dataset and blanking specific subtrees.  
For example, to highlight the impact of prepositions (\exinline{His surfboard is \swap{beneath}{lying on} him}), we first filter examples that have prepositions, and generate blanked prompts like \exinline{\ctrltag{[resemantic]} His surfboard is \texttt{[BLANK]} him.}

\emph{Prioritize diversity.}
To cover more variations around local decision boundaries, we select counterfactuals with \emph{diverse patterns} for each original instance.
We measure the similarity between counterfactuals based on weighted overlaps between their \tagstrs, the text deleted and added, and the affected parsing tree structure. 
For example, \ctrltag{lexical} changes from ``man'' to ``woman'' and ``person'' is more similar than adding the \ctrltag{quantifier} (``two man'').
%The similarity computation is in \S\ref{appendix:perturb_similarity}. 
%\wts{Need to write this part.} 
%Formally, the distance between two counterfactuals is ($a_1$ is an abbreviation for $a(\xp_1, x)$):
%$$d(\xp_1, \xp_2) = \alpha\cdot\mathbb{1}(s_1 = s_2) + \beta\cdot\mathbb{1}(r_1 = r_2) + \gamma\cdot\mathbb{1}(a_1=a_2)$$
%With $\gamma = \beta > \alpha$ (empirically $2/5$, $2/5$, $1/5$).

\subsection{Evaluation via Contrast Sets}
\label{subsec:contrast_set}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\TableAugSST
\TableAugNLI
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\paragraph{Collection} 
We crowdsource the labels for the counterfactuals on Amazon Mechanical Turk. 
For each round, the annotator is given the original instance $x$ and its groundtruth as references, and they are tasked to label three counterfactuals by (1) classification task label and (2) validity (\emph{``likely written by a native English speaker''}). 
We carefully remove noisy workers using hidden \emph{gold rounds}, as well as filters on label distributions and completion time.
We also remove noisy labels through majority votes.
More details are in \S\ref{appendix:label_instruct}. 
For each task, we crowd labeled 1,500 $\xp$ on 500 original $x$, and kept around 400 of them on 270 $x$ after validity and majority vote filtering.\footnote{For \qqp and \nli, we only perturbed \emph{duplicate} and \emph{entailment} examples, as others are significantly harder to change.}
Following the contrast set definition~\cite{gardner2020contrast}, we also filter the counterfactuals to only keep those whose groundtruth label is different from $x$'s, resulting in contrast sets with size 100-300.
%: 106 $\xp$ on 88 $x$ for \sst, 276 $\xp$ on 202 $x$ for \nli, 243 $\xp$ on 185 $x$ for \qqp.
We changed the \nli labels for 60\% of the time, whereas \sst was harder (only flipping 36.9\%).

\paragraph{Models \& results.}
We test opensourced HuggingFace models~\cite{Wolf2019HuggingFacesTS}:
DistilBERT fintuned on SST-2 for \sst\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english}},
RoBERTa fintuned on MNLI for \nli\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/roberta-large-mnli}},
and BERT fintuned on QQP\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/textattack/bert-base-uncased-QQP}}.
We report model accuracies on the full validation sets, the original examples for collecting counterfactuals, and the contrast sets.
We also report consistency, \ie cases where the model predicts both the originals and the counterfactuals correctly~\cite{li2020linguistically}.
Table~\ref{table:contrast_set_result} shows that all the models perform worse on the contrast sets, and the performance decreases for a similar amount compared to the original contrast set.


\subsection{Train via Counterfactual Augmentation}
\label{subsec:augmentation}
%\paragraph{Collection.}
We collected the data through similar procedures as for contrast sets, with one change:
Because counterfactuals that do not change the groundtruth label can also improve model stability, we keep all the valid $\xp$ for one $x$, as long as at least one of them flips the groundtruth.

%\paragraph{Models.}
We finetune \texttt{roberta-base} models~\cite{liu2019roberta} in HuggingFace Transformers~\cite{Wolf2019HuggingFacesTS}.
For each augmented model (\maug), we include $m$ counterfactuals, as well as $n$ examples from the original dataset (the base examples of the counterfactuals will always be included).
Their baselines \mcomp replace the $m$ counterfactuals with another $m$ original examples.
The reported model performances are averaged across 3 training data samples, each with 4 random seeds (More in \S\ref{appendix:data_collection}).
%Comparing with these models help highlight the effectiveness of perturbations with respect to adding the same amount of original data. 

\paragraph{Results.}
As shown in Table~\ref{table:aug_sst}--\ref{table:aug_qqp}, compared to adding the same amount of original data, \emph{the augmentation helps improve models' generalization accuracy} on out-of-domain datasets, challenge and contrast sets, as well as CheckList testing results.
%Critically, in \nli and \qqp, the improvement maintains even when the augmentation size is small (\eg when $m/n<10\%$).
Meanwhile, it maintains the in-domain accuracy.

Importantly, in both \nli and \qqp, \emph{just adding $m/n < 10\%$ data is sufficient to boost the performance.}, while \citet{huang2020counterfactually} asserted that too much counterfactual augmentation ($m=6,600$ to $n=1,700$) did not improve model generalization accuracy over adding non-counterfactual data.

\TableAugQQP


\emph{However, random counterfactuals may be insufficient.}
Unlike for \sst, random counterfactuals are not effective for \nli or \qqp models, possibly because certain augmentations were repetitive (See \S\ref{subsec:gen_counterfactual_for_labeling}).
Instead, we adjust \citet{chen2019slice}'s data slicing strategies to prioritize counterfactuals related to error cases, \eg prepositions in DNC~\cite{kim2019probing} for \nli, and entity orders in CheckList for \qqp.
The targeted augmentations then improve \maug in Table~\ref{table:aug_nli} and~\ref{table:aug_qqp}.

\emph{The counterfactuals usually improve the model without hurting its counterpart.}
In \nli, DNC includes pairs of probing examples, one from the original MNLI and one manually probed for a given linguistic pattern.
%Because DNC includes both the probing counterfactuals and their paired original data, we can safely conclude that the model did not overfit to the augmented pattern.
The improvement on it shows that \maug did not overfit to the augmented pattern.
Similarly, the gain on CheckList tests are mostly consistent in \qqp (\eg all tests related to entity ordering were improved), except for \texttt{more X $\not\eq$ less X} and \texttt{more X $=$ less antonym(X)}.
Future work should further strategize the ranking to more equally cover competing patterns. 




\subsection{Labeling Validity Rate \& efficiency}
\label{subsec:label_efficiency}

\paragraph{Validity rate.}
Crowd workers rated most counterfactuals to be valid and realistic: $75.0\%$ for \dsst, $70.0\%$ for \dqqp, and $81.7\%$ for \dnli.
One of the authors also manually labeled 600 counterfactuals generated from 120 instances in the three classification tasks, and arrived at similar validation rates:
The rate of unfiltered counterfactuals was $61.5\%$, which increased to $78.3\%$ after filtering, showing that the filtering is effective.

\paragraph{Efficiency.}
Labeling three counterfactuals of a given example is reasonably easy, as (1) annotators are better at \emph{verifying} counterfactuals than manually \emph{generating} them~\cite{ribeiro2018sear}, and (2) annotators only need to focus on the reference example and the corresponding perturbed phrases, rather than re-parsing the full instance for each label they submit~\cite{Khashabi2020MoreBF}.
As a result, the median time for labeling one round (three counterfactuals) is 30 seconds.
Even in the most extreme (and very rare) case where we only keep 100 contrast set examples after 500 rounds of validation, the average ``creation'' time per counterfactual is 2.5 minutes, which is still 40\% more efficient than manual creation:
\citet{kaushik2019learning} reported that workers spent roughly 5 minutes to revise an IMDb review and 4 minutes a sentence (for \nli), even prior to additional filtering and validation.
%Similarly, \citet{gardner2020contrast} mentioned that three expert annotators spent 70 hours to create 588 counterfactual examples for IMDb review.

%Even for shorter image captions in NLVR2 visual reasoning dataset~\cite{suhr2018corpus}, annotations would take approximately 30 seconds for one textual perturbation.


%That said, manual creations are more flexible, and can take into account contexts beyond the prompt. 
%We discuss the opportunity for human-\sysname collaboration in \S\ref{sec:discuss}.







\begin{comment}
\emph{The ratio of the counterfactuals matters. }
In both \nli and \qqp, just adding $m/n < 10\%$ data is sufficient to boost the performance.
In \sst, while the counterfactual remains effective on most datasets, it hurts the model performance on Amzbook when the counterfactual takes a large proportion (Figure~\ref{fig:sst_trend}, Yelp followed a similar but more mild trend).
We suspect that flipping out too much original data affects the data diversity, and in turn decreases the model performance.
Similarly, \citet{huang2020counterfactually} asserted that augmenting $n=1.7k$ NLI data with $m=6.6k$ counterfactuals did not improve model generalization accuracy over augmenting with non-counterfactual data.
