\section{GPT-2 as Counterfactual Generator}
\label{appendix:train_data}

\subsection{Training data collection}


We combine the following NLP datasets for finetuning \sysname.
To achieve a more balanced distribution, for each dataset, we extract \tagstrs from all the data pairs available, and randomly sample up to 10,000 instances per \tagstr.
The distribution is shown in Table~\ref{table:gpt_train_stats}.

\paragraph{Contrast set}
Authors of 10 existing NLP dataset each manually perturbed 100--1,000 instances in small but meaningful ways that change the gold label, so to inspect a model's decision boundary around a local instance~\cite{gardner2020contrast}.
The perturbation patterns vary based on the tasks and the annotators, allowing us to learn diverse strategies.
To make sure we can use the contrast set to evaluate the \sst model, we excluded the IMDb movie review from the training.\footnote{Similarly, though \qqp would be a potentially interesting dataset for training \sysname, we omitted it so \qqp can be used in our evaluation.}
%\wts{Re-train the model with other contrast sets.}


\paragraph{Counterfactually-augmented data (CAD)}
To augment the training data, \citet{kaushik2019learning} crowdsourced counterfactuals for IMDb movie review (1.7k counterfactuals on 1.7k original instances) and SNLI (6.6k counterfactuals on 1.67k original).
Similar to the contrast set, CAD's perturbation patterns vary based on the task, but can especially contribute to \ctrltag{negation}.
We split the movie review paragraphs into paired sentences, to match the sentence length of other datasets.


\paragraph{WinoGrande} is a large-scale dataset of 44k instances for testing common sense problems~\cite{sakaguchi2019winogrande}.
The dataset contains nearly identical sentences that differ only by one trigger word (\eg one noun), which flips the correct answer choice for certain questions.
The dataset is most suitable for learning lexical exchanges.

\paragraph{ParaNMT-50M} contains 50 million English-English sentential paraphrase pairs, covering various domains and styles of text, as well as different sentence structures~\cite{wieting2017paranmt}. 

\paragraph{PAWS} contains 108k paraphrasing and non-paraphrasing pairs with high lexical overlaps. 
\citet{zhang2019paws} created such challenging pairs through controlled word swapping and back translation.
As a result, the dataset demonstrates the \ctrltag{shuffle} and \ctrltag{restructure} strategies.


\paragraph{HANS} is a controlled evaluation dataset designed for testing decision boundaries of NLI models~\cite{mccoy2019right}. 
The dataset contains 10k pairs of premises and hypotheses created based on 10 heavily fallible syntactic templates, and therefore compensates rarer structural changes that may be missed by PAWS.


\paragraph{Crawled} 
We additionally crawl naturally occurring sentence pairs from non-paired datasets like SQuAD~\cite{rajpurkar-etal-2016-squad} to boost some specific patterns and increase lexical diversity. 
We estimate \emph{close} pairs using edit distance, and broadly included pairs as long as the editing is less than 60\%.
This inevitably includes cases that should not be considered counterfactuals,\eg \exinline{how do I not be} and \exinline{how do I recover it} are incorrectly considered \ctrltag{negation} pairs. 
We only include them for the most determined patterns, \ie \ctrltag{lexical}, \ctrltag{insert}, \ctrltag{delete}, and \ctrltag{shuffle}.
Among them, we further filter the pairs using \tagstrs (see the section below).
%Still, unrelated examples 


\subsection{Training Prompts \& Parameters}

Given a sentence pair, we use the two sentences interchangeably as $x$ and $\xp$ to learn the counterfactuals both ways.
For a $(x, \xp)$, we compute its primary \tagstr based on linguistic features like part-of-speech tagging or dependency trees, and blank out the changed subtrees in $\xp$.
For example, \ctrltag{negation} occurs when we observe changes on negation modifiers or specific words like ``supposedly'', and \ctrltag{shuffle} occurs when we have overlaps between tokens deleted and added.
When multiple changes occur, we label it with the primary \tagstr, which most significantly changes the semantic meaning on the corresponding subphrase.
In Figure~\ref{fig:blank}A, we use the \tagstrshort \ctrltag{negation}, as \swap{great}{not great} is more significant than \swap{kids}{children}.
If we cannot identify the \tagstr for a $(x, \xp)$ or if the editing distance is too large, we denote it with \ctrltag{global} and use it as a negative training sample.
Importantly, to allow flexible blanking at the generation time, we generate multiple training prompts from one $(x, \xp)$, with different blanking strategies: (1) just the changed tokens, (2) the associated parsing structures, (3) the merged changes, and (4) the entire sentence.
As a result, we form up to four unique training prompts given one $(x, \xp)$ pair (some examples are in Figure~\ref{fig:blank}).

%max_log_prob_diff

With the interchangeable orders and the blanks, we generate 657,144 training prompts from 191,415 sentence pairs.
We use the data to finetune an off-the-shelf GPT-2 model from \citet{Wolf2019HuggingFacesTS}, but any LM can potentially be used.
%\wts{Add the training hyperparameters; And maybe eventually move them to appendix.}
We finetuned the model for 3 epochs, with an initial learning rate 5e-5, a batch size of 16 and a sequence length of 120.


\subsection{Intrinsic Evaluations}
\label{appendix:intrinsic}






\subsubsection{Controllability with Ablation Studies}
\label{appendix:ablation_control}

We finetune another GPT-2 model with training prompts that \emph{do not} contain \tagstrs (called \emph{\sysname-a}), and quantify the impact of the \tagstrshorts through an ablation study.
For each \tagstr, we compare the \emph{control success rate} of \sysname and \sysname-a on 250 prompts (from 100 unique original sentences).
For each prompt, we generate counterfactuals through beam search (beam $=10$), and recompute the \tagstrshorts on the top three returns.
We deem the control successful if at least one of the three recomputed \tagstrshorts matches the input (though in \sysname-a, we only measure whether the \tagstrshort naturally occurs in the uncontrolled generation.)
The success rate increases by $28.4\% \pm 18.2\%$ across all \tagstrs, ranging from \ctrltag{quantifier} (increasing 8\%, from 40.4\% to 48.4\%) to \ctrltag{insert} (64.1\%, from 13.5\% to 78.6\%).
%\ctrltag{lexical} has the smallest increment \tofix{from $93\%$ to $100\%$}, mostly because \emph{\sysname-a} tend to frequently replace words.
%\ctrltag{insert} is the most impactful \tagstrshort (from \tofix{$12\%$ to $100\%$}) --- \sysname-a rarely insert additional clues on its own.

There are three common failure cases for the \tagstrshorts:
%Note that all the prompts used are guaranteed to allow the corresponding \tagstrs, and the \tagstrshorts can be less effective on more general prompts:
(1) The dual manipulation from the \tagstrs and the blanks can conflict, \eg \exinline{a dog is embraced by a \texttt{[BLANK]}} would not respond to \ctrltag{negation}.
(2) $x$ does not have a corresponding pattern. \ctrltag{shuffle} is not applicable when the sentence has only one adjective or noun (\eg \exinline{the movie is good}).
(3) Certain pattern is very prominent that it dominates the generation probability, \eg the model tends to perturb the quantifier ``two'' in \exinline{two dogs are running}, regardless of the \tagstrshort.
In the ablation study, we filtered out prompts that fell under cases 1 and 2.

\end{table}

\subsubsection{Closeness, Diversity, Fluency}

Similar to \citet{madaan2020generate}, we verify that the \sysname generations are fluent (``plausible'' in their case) through human evaluations (\S\ref{subsec:label_efficiency}).
We also quantify the diversity and closeness by comparing it with baseline models.

For a given $x$ and its generated counterfactuals $\hat{\xset}$, we approximate \emph{diversity} using self-BLEU~\cite{malandrakis-etal-2019-controlled, zhu2018texygen} within the generated counterfactual set $\hat{\xset}$.
The higher the BLEU, the more lexically different the generated phrases are to each other (Note that this only reflects one form of $\relation{\xp}$ relationship that is task-agnostic, and is not the only possible measurement for diversity). 
Meanwhile, \emph{closeness} is measured using both the average semantic and syntactic distance between $x$ and every $\xp \in \hat{\xset}$.
We compute the semantic distance using a pretrained sentence similarity model~\cite{reimers-2019-sentence-bert}, and the syntactic one using the tree edit distance~\cite{zhang1989simple}.


We use similar baselines as \citet{madaan2020generate}: 
(1) \emph{Masked-LM}, where we blank certain parts of $x$ (by randomly placing up to three \texttt{[MASK]} tokens), and ask RoBERTa to fill in the blank.
We rely on the CheckList implementation~\cite{checklist:acl20}, as it allows filling in multiple blanks at once through beam search. 

(2) \emph{PPLM-BoW}~\cite{Dathathri2020Plug}, a model that uses bag-of-words to control the generation.
We use the first two words of $x$ as the input context (prompt), limit the length of the generation to be similar to $x$, and apply their default condition ``positive words.''
As the model generates \emph{arbitrary text} that do not depend on $x$, we agree with \citet{madaan2020generate} that PPLM-BoW should not satisfy the \emph{closeness} requirement.

We randomly select 120 instances from three classification tasks, \qqp, \nli, and \sst (40 per task), and generate 10 counterfactuals per $x$ using each of the three generators.
The averaged metrics are in Table~\ref{table:intrinsic}.
\sysname achieves compatible diversity with PPLM-BoW (self-BLEU score), and compatible \emph{closeness} with Masked-LM, achieving a balance between both.


Ideally, we would also like to compare \sysname with our concurrent work GYC~\cite{madaan2020generate} and MiCE~\cite{ross2020explaining}.
Inspired by style transfer~\cite{yang2018unsupervised} and controlled text generation, GYC performs the perturbation on the latent space of the input $x$.
Meanwhile, MiCE uses a two-step framework to generate conterfactual explanations, with the generator being T5~\cite{JMLR:v21:20-074} finetuned on the task-specific dataset.
As mentioned in \S\ref{sec:relate}, both generators focus on flipping the class label of a given $x$.
Unfortunately, both require extensive implementation or finetuning, and has yet to be opensourced.

%Still, we believe that our infilling (\texttt{BLANK}) structure will improve the \emph{closeness} over the unconstrained GYC (called content and syntactic preservation in their case).
%We also hypothesize that \sysname has better (or at least compatible) diversity than GYC. 
%Per their intended use case --- model testing and debiasing --- the control functions in GYC are driven by the predictor-of-interest (\eg sentiment classifier, NER tagger). 
%As a result, most of the GYC changes seem to focus on features deemed important by the classifier (\eg \exinline{I am very disappointed with the service} is changed by \swap{disappointed}{pleased}, \swap{disappointed}{happy}, \swap{disappointed with}{pleased to get a good}).
